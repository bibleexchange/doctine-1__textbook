## The Fact of the Fall

The most tragic event connected with man is his fall into sin. Genesis 3:1-6 reveals that the first man fell. The steps in the fall were:

### Listening to slanders about God. vs. 1

Hath God said…?

### Doubting God’s Word and His love. vs. 4,5

“God is keeping something wonderful from you!”

### Looking at what God has forbidden.

And when the woman saw…the tree v. 6 (Compare with Joshua 7:21.)

Note the steps of sin:

1. “I saw”
2. “I coveted”
3. “I took”
4. “I hid”

### Lusting for what God has prohibited. v.6

Here we have the “Lust of the flesh”, “Lust of the eyes” and the “Pride of life” spoken of in 1 John 2:16. (Compare with Luke 4:1-15.)
