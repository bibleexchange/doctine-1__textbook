## The Results of the Fall

### Upon Man’s Physical Nature

#### The ground was cursed, so that henceforth it would not yield good alone (Gen. 3:17)

“How often are all the fruits of man's toll destroyed by blasting, by mildew, by insects, wet weather, land floods, etc.! Anxiety and carefulness are the labouring man's portion.”—Adam Clarke

#### Multiplied sorrow and pain to the woman in childbearing and labor, and subjection of the woman to her husband (Gen. 3:16)

…I will multiply…could also be rendered “in multiplying, I will multiply” as it is rendered in Genesis 22:17. Here is a figure of speech expressing a multiplication ontop of a multiplication. What pain the woman experiences in childbirth since the fall is in the very least much greater than was ever intended.

…and he shall rule over thee. In the beginning a great responsibility was given to Adam to care for, have dommionion over and protect God’s creation. God looked down on Adam’s solitude and said it was not good for man to be alone. This is why God created Eve. She was to be a ‘help meet” to Adam in his great charge. At her creation, the woman had probably as much right to rule as the man, but subjection to the will of her husband is one part of her curse.

#### Exhausting physical labor in order to subsist (Gen. 3:19)

This hard labor should serve as a reminder to man of his sin. Sin is a hard master and the labor of sin is difficult. In years gone by, hard labor was a more common part of a criminal’s sentence. The hardness of the labor, combined with the amount of time served, proved to be an effective deterrent to crime. If we choose to do things our way in rebellion to God’s will, we are destined to great toil. God’s way and method is ALWAYS best. (There remains a rest to the people of God! Hebrews 4:9)

#### Physical and spiritual death (Gen. 3:19; 3:2; 5:5; Rom. 5:12)

Of course, with all this came also a fear of God, a shame of sin, a hiding from God’s presence, and finally, an expulsion from the garden. (Genesis 3:8-11, 22-24)

Adam and Eve suffered from a guilty conscience. The evidences of their guilty consciences were they ran, hid, and tried to cover themselves. There is shame, as well as death, in sin.

#### The Fall Perverted Man’s Instincts \[see ILL #1 p.58\]

The works of the flesh (Galatians 5:19-21) are a perversion of man’s instincts.

(a. Matt. 4:10; Isa. 14:12-14; b. Gen.2:17; 4:8; c. Gen. 2:15; John 10:10; d. Gen. 1:19; Isa. 56:11; e. Gen. 1:28;2 Sam. 11:2 f. Gen. 1:18;Luke 2:1)

1. WORSHIP—IDOLATRY
2. PRESERVATION—SELFISHNESS
3. ACQUISITION—COVETOUSNESS
4. APPETITE—GLUTTONY
5. REPRODUCTION—LUST
6. DOMINANCE—TYRANNY

### Upon Man’s Spiritual Nature

#### All men, without respect of condition or class, are sinners before God (Rom. 3:9,22,23; Ps. 14; Is. 53:6)

There may be differences in the degrees of sin among people, but never in the fact of sin—ALL have sinned.

#### The whole world sits under condemnation, wrath, and a curse (Rom. 3:19)

God’s law demands perfect obedience, but no sinner can yield such obedience; hence, the curse of a broken law rests upon those breaking it (John 3:36; Gal. 3:10; Eph. 2:3).

#### Unregenerate men are regarded as children of the devil and not sons of God

1 John 3:8-10; John 8:44 “Ye are of your father the devil.”

1 John 5:19—And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness. (RV: in the wicked one)  

#### The whole human race is in hopeless captivity to sin and satan (Rom. 7:14; John 8:31-36)

Ephesians 2:3—Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.

#### The entire nature of man—mentally, spiritually, morally, and physically—is sadly affected by sin.

##### The understanding is darkened (Eph. 4:18; 1 Cor. 2:14)

##### The heart is deceitful and wicked (Jer. 17:9-10)

##### The mind and conscience are defiled (Gen. 6:5; Titus 1:15)

##### The will is enfeebled (Rom. 7:18)

##### The flesh and spirit are defiled (2 Corinthians 7:1)
