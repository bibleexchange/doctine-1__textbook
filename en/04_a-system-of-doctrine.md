# A System of Doctrine

There are almost an infinite number of ways to classify doctrine. The list given is not exhaustive but are mere examples of how we can organize Biblical doctrines.

## Some Common Classifications of Bible Doctrines

1. **Exegetical Theology** — Explanatory, exposition, hermeneutics, drawing out the truth, seeks to know the true meaning of Scripture, and requires a knowledge of the original languages.
2. **Historical Theology** — Involves the study of Church History and traces the development of doctrinal interpretation.
3. **Dogmatic Theology** — The study of the fundamentals of the faith as set forth in church creeds.
4. **Biblical Theology** — Traces the progress of truth through the books of the Bible.
5. **Systematic Theology** — Biblical truth arranged in topics according to a definite system.
