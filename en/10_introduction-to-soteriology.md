# Soteriology: The Doctrine of Salvation

## INTRODUCTION TO SOTERIOLGY

Five Cardinal Doctrines:

1. Salvation (Matt. 10:22; Mark 10:26; Acts 2:21; 16:30; Eph. 2:8)
2. Healing (Matt. 4:23; Matt. 9:35; Luke 9:11; Acts 4:22; 10:38)
3. Baptism (Mark 1:4; Luke 3:3; Acts 1:22; Rom. 6:4; Eph. 4:5)
4. Sanctification (John 17:17; I Cor. 1:30; I Thess. 4:3,4; 2 Thess. 2:13)
5. Second Coming (Matt. 26:64; Mark 13:32; 14:62; Luke 21:27; Acts 1:11)

We use the term ‘cardinal doctrines’ to refer to preeminent and fundamental doctrines. Generally speaking, Cardinal Doctrines are a common bond to the majority of Believers regardless of Denomination. Most other doctrines can be logically sub-categorized under one of these five, as well.

Salvation is an all-inclusive word. The term Salvation expresses deliverance, safety, preservation, soundness, restoration, and healing.

Salvation in New Testament Greek:

1. Nouns – soteria; soterion [4991,4992] Luke 1:69; 2:30; Acts 4:12
2. Verb – sozo [4982] Matt. 1:21; John 10:9; Acts 15:11

(Numbers in these brackets refer to the lexicon in Strong’s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible.)

The concept and state of salvation is viewed in the past (Rom. 8: 24), present (I Cor. 15: 2), and future (Rom. 13: 11) tenses in the Scriptures.

To be saved is to be freed:

1. From the curse of the law (Gal. 3:13)
2. From wrath (1 Thess. 5:9)
3. From death (2 Cor. 7:10)
4. From destruction (2 Thess. 1:9)

* We were lost, but we are now found (saved).
* We were bound, but we are now free.
* We were blind, but we now can see.
* We were condemned, but we are now free from condemnation (Romans 8:1).

We will be dealing with the subject: What Constitutes Salvation? [or] The State of Grace
