# Harmartiology: The Doctrine of Sin

We title the study of the Doctrine of sin as Harmartiology. The root word harmartia is a Greek word for sin; it comes from a word that literally means to miss the mark and not share in the prize. The suffix –ology identifies a ‘science’. It is called a science because it consists of systematically and logically arranged facts.

## The Scene of the Fall

### The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil

In the midst of the garden was placed two trees of destiny. The first was a tree of life, but the second was the forbidden tree of knowledge of good and evil. Why did God place such a horrid tree in the midst of Eden’s blissful paradise? It was a test for man.

### The Tempter

In his temptation of the Crown of God’s Creation, satan employed the agent of a serpent. The outstanding characteristic of this serpent was that it was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. The serpent, satan, was that eternally damned and rebellious angel of God. Why would he be allowed to put one foot into the garden, or be allowed to operate in that blessed place? It was a test for man.

### The Test

The preceding answer leads us to one ultimate question of purpose—Why was it necessary for man to be tested?

First, God’s desire is to fellowship with a people that chooses to love Him. He is not content to have the admiration of mindless robots. Second, in order for there to be a ‘choice’ there must be at least two options or there is really no ‘choosing.’ Therefore, the Tree of Knowledge was placed in the garden to test man’s devotion to God.

Let us consider two other relevant questions:

1. Did man’s failure reflect at all on God? No. God is infallible. God created and designed man, but He also gave man the freedom of choice. Man’s fall does not expose some flaw in God’s design, but emphasizes the wonderfulness of God’s design. God designed it so that man could choose God, but he also had the liberty to not choose God and His ways.
2. Did Adam HAVE to sin? No. If Adam HAD to sin, there would still have existed no true ‘choice’ for Adam simply would have had ‘no choice’ but to sin. With every test from God comes also the grace to overcome! We can pass the test by the grace of God. There existed for Adam and still exists for us the potential of not falling (Jude 1:24).
