## The Nature of Salvation

### Three Aspects of Salvation

1. Justification (A judicial term bringing into our minds a courtroom scene)
2. Regeneration (Born into the family, bringing to our minds a household scene)
3. Sanctification (Connected with worship, bringing to our minds a temple scene)

A saved man is one who has been set right with God (JUSTIFICATION) and born into the family of God (REGENERATION) and is now dedicated to the service of God (SANCTIFICATION).

1. Being justified, he is made righteous.
2. Being regenerated, he is a child of God.
3. Being sanctified, he is a “saint.”

Do these blessings follow one another or are do they take place simultaneously? We do see a logical order:

1. Set right in relation to God’s law (Romans 3:24) - JUSTIFIED
2. A new nature is imparted (John 3:6) - REGENERATED
3. Separated unto a new life and service (Ephesians 2:10) - SANCTIFIED

Yet, the three experiences are simultaneous, and are separated only for the purpose of understanding and study. By one application of the precious blood of Jesus are all three experiences received. In an instant, we are justified, regenerated, and sanctified.

Although sanctification is a definite work accomplished at salvation, sanctification is also an on-going process. The ultimate condition of complete sanctification is perfection. (We will look closer at sanctification in a later study.)

All three blessings were procured by the atoning death of Christ. Also, all three blessings flow from our union with Christ (2 Cor. 5:21; Eph. 1:7; 2 Cor. 5:17).

### Salvation is Two-fold: OUTWARD & INWARD

#### Justification

A change in position: WAS in sin, NOW “In Christ” (2 Cor. 5:17).

A change in condition: sinful to righteous (Ps. 51:5; I Cor. 6:11).

It means to be set in right relationship with God. When we are justified, we are made righteous. It is ‘Just-as-if-I’d’ never sinned.

#### Regeneration

A change in nature — “new creature”

WAS a Child of the Devil, NOW a Child of God (Divine nature)

#### Sanctification

A change in character — “old things passed away, all things new”

Having the Fruit of the Spirit and putting on Christ (Gal. 5:22-24).

Outward separation and inward purification from sin (2 Cor. 7:1).

### The Conditions of Salvation

#### What is meant by conditions of salvation?

God’s requirements in the man whom He accepts for Christ’s sake and on whom He freely bestows the blessings of the gospel of grace. Under what conditions does God bestow the free gift of salvation? Simply, there must be life! (Rom. 8:16)

#### What are the conditions of salvation?

The Scriptures set forth: Repentance — Faith — Confession (Mark 1:15; Acts 22:16; 16:31; Rom. 10:9-10; Heb. 11:6; Acts 8: 13, 21).

#### Is intellectual faith sufficient?

No. We must have more than what the devils have! They believe and tremble and still work against the will of God (James 2:19). D. L. Moody said, “Doubt your doubts and believe God.”

See also Acts 8:13, 21.

#### What is the difference between faith and belief?

Faith is a Divine activity (Eph. 6:17; John 6:44; Rom. 10:17). Believing is a human action. God expects us to respond to the faith he has placed in us and He commands us to believe. (Mark 5:36) When God draws men, he is looking for something in him for we cannot respond properly to God unless we have faith. Hebrews 12:2—Jesus the author and finisher of our faith. He helps us to believe.

John 1:1 “Word” logos \[3056\] a written Word, living Word (natural essence). The Holy Bible and Christ, the living Word, are logos.

Rom. 10:17 “Word” rhema \[4487\] àspoken Word (supernatural essence); Rhema refers to a special Word spoken by the Spirit to you. It is the revealed Word of God.

#### What is the difference between repentance and faith concerning salvation?

| Faith is concerned with God's Promises. | Repentance is concerned with sin. |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Receives Salvation.                     | Renounces sin.                    |

Faith dwells upon God’s mercy (Eph. 2:8-9; Luke 18:13; 13:3).

#### What is God’s command to all men?

Every individual is required to repent, including those in the Church (Acts 17:30; Rev. 2:5, 16, 21; 3:3, 19). To repent is to stop doing whatever it is you are doing. Some denominations suggest you repent of all sins at salvation—past, present and future. How can you repent of (stop doing) something you haven’t done? We can only repent of sins past and present.

#### Can there be faith without repentance?

No. No one can receive the promises of God without repentance (Mark 1:15; Jonah 3:5-10).

#### Can there be godly repentance without faith? 

No. We need God at every step in our Christian experience and are wholly dependent on Him. We must receive every Christian grace from God and God only responds to faith (Heb. 11:6; 2 Tim. 2:25). It is the Holy Ghost that brings conviction of sin which leads men to repentance.

#### Are faith and repentance simply preparatory to salvation?

No. Faith and repentance are continuous motions in the life of the Believer (Ephesians 3:17; Revelation 3:19).

### Conversion (Acts 3:19; Matt. 18:3; Luke 22:32; James 5:20)

#### Conversion involves the whole person

1. Intellectually (Acts 2:37-38) “they heard”
2. Emotionally (Acts 2:37-38) “pricked in their heart”
3. Volitionally (Acts 16:27-31) “What shall we do?”

#### How is conversion distinguished from salvation?

Conversion describes the human or man-ward side of salvation (Luke 19:8-9; Acts 9:11; 16:33-34; Phil. 2:12-13).

#### Which comes first—regeneration or conversion?

One does not necessarily precede the other. It is more accurate to say that regeneration is God’s action in man and conversion is man’s action toward God. Regeneration and conversion work together at once.

“Somewhere between the limb and the ground, Zaccheus was converted.” — D. L. Moody
