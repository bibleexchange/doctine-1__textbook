## The Record of Angels

### Heavenly Host (Luke 2:13; Job 38:7)

### The Angel of the Lord

There are four angels named or titled in the Bible. The first mention of angels in the Bible is Genesis 16:7. The "angel of the Lord" told Hagar to return to Sarai.

This is the first of many times "The Angel of the Lord" delivered messages:

1. Spoke to Moses out of a burning bush (Ex. 3:2)
2. Spoke to Manoah and his wife about Samson (Judges 13:2)
3. Prevented Balaam (Numbers 22:22)
4. Appeared unto Gideon (Judges 6:12)

### Lucifer

Lucifer means daystar, shining, or bright one. In his rebellion against God, Lucifer fell into the condemnation of the devil becoming the chief of the fallen angels and adversary of God. Lucifer’s fall is described in Isaiah 14:12-14 and Ezekiel 28:12-15. Before his fall, Lucifer was a magnificent angel who in pride tried to exalt himself above the other angels as God’s equal. He was created into a lofty position, but fell far from it (John 8:44; I Timothy 3:6).

In his fall, Lucifer drew one-third of the angels of heaven with him. In a great war in Heaven, satan and his followers were cast out of heaven (Revelation 12:4).

### Michael

Michael is the only angel referred to as an archangel. His chief responsibility seems to be a militant protection of God’s people (Daniel 12:1).

The word "prince" in this verse means ruler, commander, chief, or leader. Jude 9 describes a confrontation between Michael and satan. Michael is presented as an angel of battle and war (Revelation 12:7).

### Gabriel

Gabriel is a messenger in the four times he is mentioned in the Bible (Daniel 8:16; 9:21; Luke 1:19, 26). Some have speculated that Gabriel is an archangel, but there is no verse of Scripture to confirm this.
