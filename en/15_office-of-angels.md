## The Office of Angels

### Ministering Spirits (Heb. 1:14)

#### To God

The main duty of angels is to worship and serve God. Angels worshipping and serving God are portrayed many times in the Bible and especially in the book of Revelation. Angels worship and carry out the commands of God (Hebrews 1:6; I Peter 3:22; Revelation 5:11; 14:10; <!--Following Not in SW--> Dan 7:10; 1Ki 22:19; II Ki 6:16-17; IIChr 32:7-8;Ps 68:17;103:20-21; He12:22; Re 5:11).

#### To Man

Angels have been given the task by God to minister to His people (Hebrews 1:14).

##### Protecting (Psalm 34:7; Exodus 14:19; Psalm 91:11-12)

##### Revealing and Guiding

The angel Gabriel instructed Daniel on the meaning of his dreams and visions (Daniel 8:16; 9:21). Many times in the Bible, angels delivered messages from God to men. An angel told Zechariahs he would have a son named him John (Luke 1:19). The greatest message ever carried was Gabriel’s message to Mary that she would conceive a son and call His name Jesus.

We are warned in Galatians 1:8 that if even an angel from Heaven were to preach any other Gospel, he is to be accursed. Even the message of angels is to be tested by the Word.

##### Providing

God has used angels to provide physical needs such as food for Hagar (Genesis 21:17-20), Elijah (1 Kings 19:6), and Christ after His temptation (Matthew 4:11).

##### Delivering

Getting God's people out of danger. Angels released the apostles from prison in Acts 5, and again for Peter in Acts 12:7-9. In Daniel 6:22, an angel shut the lions’ mouth for Daniel.

##### Strengthening and encouraging

Angels strengthened Jesus after His temptation (Matt 4:11), encouraged the apostles to keep preaching after releasing them from prison (Acts 5:19-20), and told Paul that everyone on his ship would survive the impending shipwreck (Acts 27:23-25).

##### Answering prayer

God often uses angels as His means of answering the prayers of His people (Daniel 9:20-24; 10:10-12; Acts 12:1-17).

##### Caring for believers at the moment of death

In the story of Lazarus and the rich man, we read that angels carried the spirit of Lazarus to “Abraham's bosom” when he died (Luke 16:22).

### Not to be Worshipped

Although God’s are holy creatures, they are not to be worshipped. Satan tried to get Jesus to worship him, but Jesus flatly told him only God is to be worshipped. Angels are meant to worship God and in no case are they to be worshipped (Luke 4:8; Hebrews 1:6; Colossians 2:18; Romans 1:25).

We are not to worship any created being, even angels. All worship is to be directed to the Creator. It is dangerous folly for many to put unhealthy emphasis on angels. Only three names are given in Scripture out of the innumerable number that makes up the Heavenly Host; this should be an indication to us not to give undue attention and focus to angels. Our focus should be on Christ and being led by the Holy Ghost.
