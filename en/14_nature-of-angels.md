# Angelology: The Doctrine of Angels

Matthew 1:20, 24; Revelation 12:7

## The Nature of Angels

### Characteristics

The Hebrew definition of Angel is a supernatural representative of God, sometimes delivering messages, sometimes protecting God’s people.

#### Created Beings

Angels were created and have a definite beginning. They are not eternally existent in the sense that God is. They were created by God and belong to the Lord.

The number of angels is not known exactly, but since they do not procreate and they do not die, the same number exists today as when they were created. Hebrews 12:22 does describe the number of angels as ‘innumerable.’ Innumerable means uncountable; too many to count. In Matthew 26:53, it says that Jesus could have called 12 legions of angels to assist Him. A legion is 6,000 men; 12 legions would be 72,000 angels.

#### Spirit Beings (Psalm 104:4)

Although angels have male names, such as, Michael and Gabriel, angels are spirit beings and are neither male nor female (Luke 20:36).

Angels do not have families or marry. In Mark 12:25, we are told that when Christians get to Heaven they would be like the angels in the sense that they neither marry nor are given into marriage.

Angels never were human, but were created as angels. There is no Scripture that even suggests humans ever become angels, as well. Also, although they can appear as men, they do not have physical bodies. There are many examples recorded in the Bible of angels appearing as men:

1. An angel sat under an oak tree with Gideon (Judges 6:11-12)
2. An angel talked with Zechariah (Zechariah 1:9)
3. An angel appeared unto Zacharias (Luke 1:11)
4. Mary saw in angel (Luke 1:29)
5. We are admonished to entertain strangers because we might be entertaining angels unawares (Hebrews 13:2)

#### Powerful but Limited

Angels are very powerful beings, but their power is limited. One angel killed 185,000 Assyrians in one night. (2 Kings 19:35) Another angel was sent by God to destroy Jerusalem, yet could not complete the destruction in I Chronicles 21:15. These passages show both the power and limitation of angels. They had the power to destroy entire cities, but when God told them to stop they had to stop. Angels cannot work independent of God. Even satan (a ‘fallen angel’ or the ‘devil’) needed permission from God to do anything to Job and his family.

Angels are not omnipresent, omnipotent, or omniscient. Angels will be judged by God’s people (I Cor. 6:3). Angels desire to look into the meaning of the Gospel (I Peter 1:12); this shows that their understanding is limited.

### Classes

There is a definite hierarchy of angels.

#### The Archangel

The arch angel or ‘chief angel’ is the highest ranked angel. Michael is called the arch angel in Jude 9. I Thessalonians 4:16 says when Christ returns it will be preceded by the voice of the Arch Angel.

#### Seraphim

The seraphim are mentioned only in Isaiah 6:2, 6. The name seraphim portrays burning or fiery (like having a copper color). Isaiah describes them as having six wings: two covering his face, two covering his feet and two with which to fly. The posts of the door of house shook at the voice of their crying, “Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.” One angel using tongs took a live coal from the altar and touched Isaiah’s lips. This was a symbolical purging of Isaiah’s sins.

#### Cherubim

The most frequently mentioned class of angels is the cherubim. Cherubim serve in the presence of God and guard the house of God. Cherubim were portrayed on the Ark of the Covenant and on the walls of Solomon’s Temple as standing on both sides of God beside the mercy seat.
